```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, roc_curve
from sklearn import preprocessing
```
These lines import functions for evaluating model performance (confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, roc_curve) and data preprocessing (preprocessing).

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
```
These lines import functions for splitting data into training and testing sets (train_test_split) and feature selection (RFE).

```python
import os
general_path = "D:\PUA\S4\Data Mining\project\Data"
```
This line defines a variable general_path that stores the directory path containing your data. You might need to adjust this path to match your file location.

```python
print(list(os.listdir(f'{general_path}/genres_original/')))
```
This line lists the contents of the directory genres_original within the general_path. This might be helpful to confirm the presence of genre labels.

```python
data = pd.read_csv(f'{general_path}/features_3_sec.csv')
```
This line reads the CSV file named "features_3_sec.csv" from the general_path directory into a pandas DataFrame named data. This DataFrame likely contains features extracted from audio files.

```python
data = data.iloc[0:, 1:]
```
This line selects all rows and all columns except the first one **(likely the index column)** from the data DataFrame.

```python
data.head()
```
This line displays the first few rows of the data DataFrame to get a glimpse of the features.

```python
y = data['label'] # genre variable.
X = data.loc[:, data.columns != 'label'] #select all columns but not the labels
```
These lines separate the data:

**y:** This variable stores the "label" column, which presumably contains the genre labels for each data point.
**X:** This variable stores a new DataFrame containing all columns except the "label" column. These are the features used for genre classification.

```python
cols = X.columns
min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
np_scaled = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(X)
X = pd.DataFrame(np_scaled, columns = cols)
X.head()
```
This code block normalizes the features in **X** using MinMaxScaler. Normalization transforms features to a range between 0 and 1, ensuring all features contribute equally during model training.



### X_train and X_test:
**X_train (Training Features):** This variable holds the features (data points) used to train the machine learning model. These features are the independent variables that the model will learn from to make predictions. In your code, after feature selection and normalization, X_train likely contains a DataFrame with numerical values representing the characteristics of audio samples (excluding genre labels).

**X_test (Testing Features):** This variable holds a separate set of features used to evaluate the model's performance. The model has never seen this data before during training. X_test likely contains another DataFrame similar to X_train but with different audio samples.

### y_train and y_test:

**y_train (Training Labels):** This variable holds the corresponding labels (genre classifications) for the features in X_train. These labels provide the "ground truth" that the model will use to learn the relationship between features and genres.

**y_test (Testing Labels):** This variable holds the corresponding labels for the features in X_test. These labels are used to assess the model's accuracy on unseen data. The model predicts genres for these samples, and we can compare those predictions to the actual labels in y_test.

 **Splitting the Data:**

The train_test_split function from scikit-learn (used in your code) is employed to create these separate training and testing sets. This function randomly splits the original data (X and y) into training and testing sets based on the specified test_size (usually around 20-30% for testing). This helps prevent the model from overfitting to the training data and ensures it generalizes well to unseen data.

By training the model on X_train and y_train, the model learns the patterns between features and genres. Then, when we evaluate the model on X_test and y_test, we can see how well it performs on unseen data, giving us an idea of its generalizability and potential real-world effectiveness.


```python
def get_label_order(label):
        order  = {"blues": 0,
                  "classical": 1, 
                  "country": 2, 
                  "disco": 3, 
                  "hiphop": 4, 
                  "jazz": 5, 
                  "metal": 6, 
                  "pop": 7, 
                  "reggae": 8,
                  "rock":9}
        return order[label]
y_train_encoded = [get_label_order(label) for label in y_train]
y_test_encoded = [get_label_order(label) for label in y_test]
```
The code you provided defines a function get_label_order and then uses it to encode the genre labels in y_train and y_train (training and testing sets). Let's break it down:

### Function get_label_order:

This function takes a genre label (label) as input and returns a numerical value representing the order of that genre in a predefined dictionary. Here's how it works:

Dictionary order: It creates a dictionary named order that maps genre strings (e.g., "blues") to numerical values (e.g., 0). This dictionary defines a specific order for the genres.

**Return Statement:** The function returns the value associated with the input label from the order dictionary. If the label is not found in the dictionary, it might raise a KeyError.

### Encoding Labels:

List Comprehension: The lines after the function definition use list comprehension to encode the labels in y_train and y_test.

**y_train_encoded:** This line creates a new list named y_train_encoded. It iterates through each label in y_train and calls the get_label_order function on that label. The function returns the numerical order corresponding to the genre, and this numerical value is appended to the y_train_encoded list. This process essentially replaces the genre strings in y_train with their corresponding numerical labels.

**y_test_encoded:** Similarly, this line creates another list named y_test_encoded and encodes the genre labels in y_test using the same process.

## Why Encode Labels?

### There are several reasons why machine learning algorithms often prefer numerical labels over string labels:

**Efficiency:** Numerical computations are generally faster than string manipulations.
**Standardization:** Encoding ensures all labels are represented consistently, making it easier for the model to learn the relationships between features and genres.
Some algorithms require numerical labels:** Specific machine learning algorithms might not be able to handle string labels directly. By converting them to numbers, you make the data compatible with these algorithms.

However, it's important to remember the mapping between numerical labels and genres.  For example, in this case, knowing that 0 represents "blues" and 9 represents "rock" is crucial for interpreting the model's output later.


###  How to assess Models in code :

The provided code defines a function named model_assess that takes a machine learning model (model) and an optional title (title) as input. The function likely performs the following steps to assess the model's performance:

 #### 1. Model Training:
```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train_encoded)

```
This line trains the provided model using the training features (X_train) and the encoded training labels (y_train_encoded). During training, the model learns the relationship between the features and the encoded genre labels.

#### 2. Prediction on Testing Data:

```python
preds = model.predict(X_test)
```
This line uses the trained model to make predictions on the unseen testing features (X_test). The output, stored in the variable preds, is a list of predicted genre labels (encoded numerically) for each data point in the testing set.

#### 3. Optional Confusion Matrix (Commented Out):
```python
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, preds))
```
This line (commented out) would print the confusion matrix for the model's predictions. The confusion matrix is a table that helps visualize the performance of a classification model. However, it's not explicitly used for calculating accuracy in this code.

#### 4. Accuracy Calculation and Printing:
```python
print('Accuracy', title, ':', round(accuracy_score(y_test_encoded, preds), 5), '\n')
```
This line calculates the accuracy score of the model's predictions. It uses the accuracy_score function from scikit-learn, which takes the true labels (y_test_encoded) and the predicted labels (preds) as arguments.
The round function ensures the accuracy is displayed with 5 decimal places.
Finally, it prints the calculated accuracy score along with the provided title (if any) and a newline character.

## Models of AI :

### 1-Naive Bayes Model:
The Naive Bayes classifier is a popular and powerful technique for classification tasks. It works based on Bayes' theorem, a fundamental concept in probability theory. Here's a breakdown of its operation:

#### **1. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' theorem allows you to calculate the conditional probability of event B occurring given that event A has already happened. In simpler terms, it helps you determine the likelihood of B being true knowing that A is true.

#### **2. Naive Bayes Assumption:**

The Naive Bayes model makes a strong assumption that all features (predictors) are conditionally independent of each other given the class label. In essence, it assumes that knowing the value of one feature doesn't influence the value of any other feature, as long as you know the class label. While this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios, the simplicity of the model makes it surprisingly effective in many cases.

#### **3. Classification Process:**

Here's how Naive Bayes classifies a new data point:

- Calculate the probability of each class label occurring (prior probability).
- For each class label, calculate the probability of the new data point's features given that class label (likelihood). This involves calculating the probability of each feature value considering the specific class.
- Apply Bayes' theorem to combine the prior probability and likelihood for each class.
Assign the new data point to the class with the highest resulting probability.

#### Advantages of Naive Bayes:

- Simple and easy to implement.
- Computationally efficient.
- Works well with high-dimensional data (many features).
- Performs well even with relatively small datasets.

#### Disadvantages of Naive Bayes:

- The strong independence assumption between features can be unrealistic.
- May struggle with continuous features (as it often assumes Gaussian distribution).
- Sensitive to missing data.
- Naive Bayes is a versatile tool, and there are variations like Gaussian Naive Bayes (used in your code) that assume a Gaussian distribution for features, Multinomial Naive Bayes for discrete features, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes for binary features.

### Code & explain it:
```python
nb = GaussianNB()
model_assess(nb, "Naive Bayes")
```

**1- Naive Bayes Model:**
This line creates an instance of the GaussianNB class from scikit-learn, which implements a Naive Bayes classifier assuming Gaussian distributions for the features.

**2-Model Assessment:**
This line calls the model_assess function you defined earlier. It passes two arguments:
- nb: This is the Naive Bayes model you just created.
- "Naive Bayes": This is an optional title used to identify the model in the output.

### What happens next?

- The model_assess function will take the following steps:
- Train the Naive Bayes model (nb) using the training features (X_train) and encoded training labels (y_train_encoded).
= Use the trained model to predict genre labels for the unseen testing features (X_test).
= Calculate the accuracy score by comparing the predicted labels (preds) with the true labels (y_test_encoded).
- Print the accuracy score along with the title "Naive Bayes" and a newline character.

In conclusion, Naive Bayes offers a powerful and efficient way for classification tasks despite its simplifying assumptions. Its ease of use and effectiveness make it a popular choice for various applications.

### 2- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Explained
 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a fundamental optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning, especially for training large models. It's an iterative approach used to find the minimum of a function (often the cost function in machine learning).

**Here's a breakdown of how SGD works:**

- **Cost Function:** Imagine a landscape represented by a function. The cost function defines how "good" a model is at a particular point in this landscape. Lower values indicate better performance.

- **Gradient:** The gradient of the cost function points in the direction of steepest ascent. SGD takes the negative of the gradient (direction of steepest descent) to move towards the minimum.

- **Stochastic Update:** Unlike traditional gradient descent that uses the entire dataset for each update, SGD uses a small subset of data points (mini-batch) to estimate the gradient. This stochastic (random) approach makes it faster and more memory-efficient for large datasets.

- **Learning Rate:** The learning rate controls the step size taken in the direction of the negative gradient. A larger learning rate can lead to faster convergence but might miss the minimum or even jump out of it. A smaller learning rate ensures smoother convergence but might take longer.

- **Iterations:** SGD iteratively updates the model parameters using the mini-batch gradient estimates until it reaches a stopping criterion (e.g., maximum number of iterations or convergence threshold).

```python
sgd = SGDClassifier(max_iter=5000, random_state=0)
model_assess(sgd, "Stochastic Gradient Descent")
```
- This code snippet creates an instance of the SGDClassifier class from scikit-learn, which implements the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm for classification tasks.

- max_iter=5000: This sets the maximum number of iterations SGD will perform. You can adjust this value based on your dataset size and desired convergence.

- random_state=0: This sets a seed for the random number generator used for mini-batch selection, ensuring reproducibility of the results. You can change this value to obtain slightly different random mini-batches in each run.

- The model_assess(sgd, "Stochastic Gradient Descent") line calls the function you defined earlier. It trains the SGD classifier (sgd) on your data, makes predictions on the testing set, and evaluates its accuracy using the model_assess function.

**Overall, SGD is a powerful and efficient optimization technique that allows you to train large models effectively. It trades exact gradient calculations for faster computation and better memory usage.**
**Note: There are variations of SGD like SGD with momentum and Adagrad that address some of its limitations and can potentially improve performance.**

### 3- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
KNN is a simple yet powerful supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks. It makes predictions for new data points based on the similarity of those points to existing labeled data points in the training set.

### Here's how KNN works:

1- **K Value:** You define a parameter k that determines the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction.

2- **Distance Metric:** Choose a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) to calculate similarity between data points. This metric tells you how "close" two data points are in the feature space, considering all features.

3- **Nearest Neighbors:** Given a new data point, KNN finds the k closest data points (neighbors) in the training set based on the chosen distance metric.

4- **Majority Vote (Classification):** Among the k nearest neighbors, KNN performs a majority vote (or other weighting techniques) to predict the class label for the new data point. The class label with the most representatives among the neighbors becomes the predicted class.

5- **Regression (Optional):** KNN can also be used for regression tasks by calculating the average value of a continuous target variable among the k nearest neighbors.

#### Advantages of KNN:

- Simple and easy to understand: KNN's intuitive approach makes it easy to interpret and implement.
- Effective for various datasets: KNN can handle both numerical and categorical features and works well with high-dimensional data.
- No explicit model training: KNN doesn't require complex model training procedures.

#### Disadvantages of KNN:

- Computationally expensive for large datasets: Finding nearest neighbors can be time-consuming for vast datasets.
- Sensitive to the choice of k: The model's performance depends heavily on the chosen k value.
- Curse of dimensionality: As the number of features increases, KNN can struggle with finding meaningful distances.

### **Code:**
```python
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=19)
model_assess(knn, "KNN")
```
- **Creating a KNN Classifier:** This line creates an instance of the KNeighborsClassifier class (knn) from scikit-learn to use the KNN algorithm for classification.

- Setting the n_neighbors Parameter:

- n_neighbors=19: This sets the number of neighbors (k) to consider for prediction to 19. You can experiment with different k values to find the optimal setting for your data.

**Calling model_assess: The model_assess(knn, "KNN") line calls the function you defined earlier. It performs the following steps:**

- rains the KNN classifier (knn) using the training features (X_train) and encoded training labels (y_train_encoded).
- Makes predictions on the unseen testing features (X_test).
- Calculates the accuracy score by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels (y_test_encoded).
- Prints the accuracy score along with the title "KNN" and a newline character.
- In essence, this code snippet trains a KNN model with k=19, makes predictions on unseen data, and evaluates its accuracy using the model_assess function.

#### Choosing the Right k Value:

**The choice of k significantly affects KNN's performance. Here are some guidelines:**

- **Smaller k:** More sensitive to noise in the data but can capture local variations in the class distribution.
- **Larger k:** More robust to noise but might miss local patterns and lead to overfitting.



### 4- Decision Trees

Decision Trees (DTs) are a fundamental and interpretable supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by building a tree-like model that recursively splits the data based on features to predict the target variable.

- **Here's a breakdown of how Decision Trees work for classification:**

- **Root Node: The tree starts with the entire training dataset at the root node.**

- **Feature Selection:** At each node, the algorithm chooses the best feature (based on a splitting criterion like Gini impurity or information gain) to split the data into two or more child nodes.

- **Splitting:** The data is split at the chosen feature's value, creating separate branches for different categories or ranges of values.

- **Leaf Nodes:** The process continues recursively until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., reaching a certain depth, all data points in a node belong to the same class, or no further improvement is possible). Leaf nodes represent final predictions, indicating the most likely class label for data points that reach that node.

#### Code Explanation:
```python
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model_assess(tree, "Decision Trees")
```
Creating a Decision Tree Classifier: This line creates an instance of the DecisionTreeClassifier class (tree) from scikit-learn to use the decision tree algorithm for classification.

Default Parameters: The constructor uses default parameters for the decision tree, which include choosing the best splitting feature based on the Gini impurity criterion and stopping when a certain minimum number of samples reach a leaf node or the maximum depth is reached. You can customize these parameters for finer control over the model's behavior.

Calling model_assess: The model_assess(tree, "Decision Trees") line functions similarly to the previous calls. It trains the decision tree (tree) using the training data, makes predictions on unseen data, and evaluates its accuracy using the model_assess function.

### 5- Random Forest

Random Forest (RF) is a powerful ensemble learning method for classification tasks that builds upon the strengths of decision trees. It combines the predictions of multiple decision trees (often hundreds or thousands) to create a more robust and accurate model.

#### Here's how Random Forests work:

**Building Decision Trees:** RF creates a collection of individual decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the features (with replacement) and a random subset of training data (bootstrapping).

**Randomness:** This randomness helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that each tree is unique and doesn't learn overly specific patterns from the training data.

**Prediction:** For a new data point, each tree in the forest makes a prediction, and the final prediction is typically the majority vote (or weighted average) of the individual tree predictions.

#### Code Explanation:
```python
rforest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1000, max_depth=10, random_state=0)
model_assess(rforest, "Random Forest")
```
**Creating a Random Forest Classifier:** This line creates an instance of the RandomForestClassifier class (rforest) from scikit-learn to use the random forest algorithm for classification.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

- **n_estimators=1000:** This sets the number of decision trees to build in the forest (1000 in this case). You can experiment with different values to find the optimal number for your task.
- **max_depth=10:** This limits the maximum depth of each tree to 10. Deeper trees can capture more complex relationships but are also more prone to overfitting. Tuning this parameter is crucial.
- **random_state=0:** This sets a seed for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the random trees built in the forest.
- **Calling model_assess:** The model_assess(rforest, "Random Forest") line functions similarly to the previous calls. It trains the random forest (rforest) using the training data, makes predictions on unseen data, and evaluates its accuracy using the model_assess function.

In essence, Random Forests leverage the power of multiple decision trees to create robust and accurate models for classification tasks. Tuning hyperparameters like the number of trees and maximum depth is essential for optimal performance.


### 6- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful and versatile supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. They aim to find an optimal hyperplane in the feature space that separates the data points of different classes with the maximum margin.

**Here's how SVMs work for classification:**

**Mapping Data:** The data points are mapped to a high-dimensional space (possibly using kernel functions) to create a clear separation between classes.

**Hyperplane: The SVM algorithm finds the hyperplane (a line in 2D, a plane in 3D, or a higher-dimensional equivalent) that maximizes the margin between the closest data points of each class (called support vectors).

**Margin Maximization:** This margin essentially represents the confidence of the classification. A larger margin indicates a more robust separation between classes.

**Classification:** New data points are classified based on which side of the hyperplane they fall on.

```python
svm = SVC(decision_function_shape="ovo")
model_assess(svm, "Support Vector Machine")
```

**Creating an SVM Classifier:** This line creates an instance of the SVC class (svm) from scikit-learn to use the Support Vector Machine algorithm for classification.

**decision_function_shape="ovo":** This parameter specifies the multi-class strategy. "ovo" (one-vs-one) trains a separate SVM classifier for every pair of classes, which can be computationally expensive for many classes. Other options include "ovr" (one-vs-rest) that trains a single classifier for each class against all others.

**Calling model_assess:** The model_assess(svm, "Support Vector Machine") line functions similarly to the previous calls. It trains the SVM (svm) using the training data, makes predictions on unseen data, and evaluates its accuracy using the model_assess function.

**Important Note:** The choice of kernel function is crucial for SVM performance. While the code doesn't specify it explicitly, the default kernel in scikit-learn's SVC is the radial basis function (RBF), which can work well for many datasets. However, you might need to experiment with other kernel functions like linear or polynomial depending on your specific task.


### 7- Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a fundamental statistical method used for classification tasks. It estimates the probability of a data point belonging to a specific class by fitting a logistic function (also called sigmoid function) to the data.

**Here's a breakdown of how Logistic Regression works:**

**Linear Model:** It builds a linear model that relates the features (independent variables) to the probability of belonging to a specific class (dependent variable).

**Logistic Function:** The model outputs values between 0 and 1, representing the probability of belonging to the positive class (e.g., class 1). The probability of belonging to the negative class (class 0) is simply 1 minus the predicted probability for the positive class.

**Classification Threshold:** Typically, a threshold (often 0.5) is used to classify data points. If the predicted probability for the positive class is above the threshold, it's classified as positive; otherwise, it's classified as negative. This threshold can be adjusted for specific use cases.

#### Code Explanation:
```python
lg = LogisticRegression(random_state=0, solver='lbfgs', multi_class='multinomial')
model_assess(lg, "Logistic Regression")
```
**Creating a Logistic Regression Model:** This line creates an instance of the LogisticRegression class (lg) from scikit-learn to use the Logistic Regression algorithm.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

**random_state=0:** This sets a seed for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the results.
**solver='lbfgs':** This specifies the algorithm used to solve the optimization problem for finding the best model parameters. L-BFGS is a commonly used solver in Logistic Regression.
**multi_class='multinomial':** This parameter indicates that the model should handle multi-class classification (more than two classes) using the multinomial solver, which extends the binary case to multiple classes.
**Calling model_assess:** The model_assess(lg, "Logistic Regression") line functions similarly to the previous calls. It trains the Logistic Regression model (lg) using the training data, makes predictions on unseen data, and evaluates its accuracy using the model_assess function.


### 8- Neural Networks 
Neural networks (NNs) are powerful machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons (nodes) that process information and learn from data.

**Here's a simplified breakdown of how Neural Networks work for classification:**

**Input Layer:** Receives the input features of a data point.

**Hidden Layers:** These layers perform the core computation. Each neuron in a hidden layer takes a weighted sum of its inputs from the previous layer, applies an activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU), and outputs a value. This process transforms the data and allows the network to learn complex relationships between features and the target variable.

**Output Layer:** Represents the final prediction. In classification, the output layer typically has one neuron per class, and the neuron with the highest activation value indicates the predicted class.

**Learning:** Neural networks learn by iteratively adjusting the weights between neurons based on an error function (e.g., cross-entropy loss). The goal is to minimize the error between the network's predictions and the true labels in the training data. This process is called backpropagation.

```python
nn = MLPClassifier(solver='lbfgs', alpha=1e-5, hidden_layer_sizes=(5000, 10), random_state=1)
model_assess(nn, "Neural Nets")
```

Creating a Neural Network Classifier: This line creates an instance of the MLPClassifier class (nn) from scikit-learn to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a common type of neural network for classification.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

**solver='lbfgs':** This specifies the algorithm used to optimize the network's weights during training. L-BFGS is one of the options available.
**alpha=1e-5:** This is a regularization parameter (L1 penalty) that controls the strength of the penalty on the model's weights, helping to prevent overfitting.
**hidden_layer_sizes=(5000, 10):** This defines the architecture of the neural network. It has two hidden layers: the first with 5000 neurons and the second with 10 neurons. You can experiment with different architectures to find the optimal configuration for your task.
**random_state=1:** This sets a seed for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the network initialization.
**Calling model_assess:** The model_assess(nn, "Neural Nets") line functions similarly to the previous calls. It trains the neural network (nn) using the training data, makes predictions on unseen data, and evaluates its accuracy using the model_assess function.

### 9- Cross Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning model for classification and regression tasks. It's an ensemble learning method that builds upon the strengths of Gradient Boosting by introducing several improvements.

**Here's a breakdown of XGBoost for classification:**

**Gradient Boosting Foundation:** XGBoost builds a sequence of decision trees sequentially, similar to Gradient Boosting. Each new tree focuses on correcting the errors of the previous ones.

**Regularization:** XGBoost incorporates regularization techniques like L1 and L2 penalties to control the complexity of individual trees and prevent overfitting.

**Sparsity:** XGBoost encourages sparse trees, meaning most splits in the trees only consider a few features. This improves efficiency and reduces overfitting.

**Parallelization:** XGBoost is optimized for parallel and distributed computing, making it efficient for handling large datasets.

```python
xgb = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.05)
model_assess(xgb, "Cross Gradient Booster")
```
**reating an XGBoost Classifier:** This line creates an instance of the XGBClassifier class (xgb) from scikit-learn to use XGBoost for classification.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

**n_estimators=1000:** This sets the number of decision trees (estimators) to build in the ensemble (1000 in this case). You can experiment with different values to find the optimal number.
**learning_rate=0.05:** This controls the step size for updating the model with each iteration. A smaller learning rate is used here (0.05) compared to some other algorithms, which is common with XGBoost due to its stage-wise optimization.
**Calling model_assess:** The model_assess(xgb, "Cross Gradient Booster") line functions similarly to the previous calls. It trains the XGBoost model (xgb) using the training data, makes predictions on unseen data, and evaluates its accuracy using the model_assess function.

**Important Note:** XGBoost has many other hyperparameters that can be tuned for optimal performance. You might want to consider exploring additional parameters like max_depth (maximum tree depth), reg_alpha (L1 regularization), and reg_lambda (L2 regularization) for further improvement.

### 10- XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting):

- Ensemble Learning Method: XGBoost is a powerful ensemble learning technique for classification and regression tasks. It builds a sequence of decision trees sequentially, similar to Gradient Boosting, where each new tree learns to correct the errors of the previous ones.
- Strengths:
- - High Performance: XGBoost is known for achieving state-of-the-art performance on various classification tasks.
  - Robust to Overfitting: Regularization techniques like L1 and L2 penalties control tree complexity and prevent overfitting.
  - Handles Missing Data: XGBoost can handle missing data efficiently.
  - Parallel Processing: Optimized for parallel and distributed computing, making it efficient for handling large datasets.
  - Interpretability: While not as interpretable as single decision trees, XGBoost offers feature importance scores to understand the relative influence of features.


```python
#Cross Gradient Booster (Random Forest)
xgbrf = XGBRFClassifier(objective= 'multi:softmax')
model_assess(xgbrf, "Cross Gradient Booster (Random Forest)")
```
